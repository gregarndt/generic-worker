A generic worker for task cluster, written in go.

# Install binary

* Download the latest release for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/releases
* Download the latest release of livelog for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/livelog/releases
* For darwin/linux, make the binaries executable: `chmod a+x {generic-worker,livelog}*`

# Build from source

If you prefer not to use a prepackaged binary, or want to have the latest unreleased version from the development head:

* Head over to http://golang.org/doc/install and follow the instructions for your platform. Be sure to set your GOPATH to something appropriate.
* Run `go get github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker`
* Run `go get github.com/taskcluster/livelog`

All being well, the binaries will be built under `${GOPATH}/bin`.

# Create TaskCluster account

Head over to https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/clients/ and create yourself a clientId with permanent credentials. Then go to https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/roles/ and create a role called `client-id:<your-client-id>` and give it the scope `worker-developer`. Keep a note of your clientId and accessToken.

# Set up your env

View the generic worker help, to see what config you need to set up:

```
generic-worker --help
```

This should display something like this:

generic-worker
generic-worker is a taskcluster worker that can run on any platform that supports go (golang).
See http://taskcluster.github.io/generic-worker/ for more details. Essentially, the worker is
the taskcluster component that executes tasks. It requests tasks from the taskcluster queue,
and reports back results to the queue.

  Usage:
    generic-worker run                      [--config         CONFIG-FILE]
                                            [--configure-for-aws]
    generic-worker install (startup|service [--nssm           NSSM-EXE]
                                            [--service-name   SERVICE-NAME])
                                            [--config         CONFIG-FILE]
                                            [--username       USERNAME]
                                            [--password       PASSWORD]
    generic-worker show-payload-schema
    generic-worker new-openpgp-keypair      --file PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    generic-worker --help
    generic-worker --version

  Targets:
    run                                     Runs the generic-worker in an infinite loop.
    show-payload-schema                     Each taskcluster task defines a payload to be
                                            interpreted by the worker that executes it. This
                                            payload is validated against a json schema baked
                                            into the release. This option outputs the json
                                            schema used in this version of the generic
                                            worker.
    install                                 This will install the generic worker as a
                                            Windows service. If the Windows user USERNAME
                                            does not already exist on the system, the user
                                            will be created. This user will be used to run
                                            the service.
    new-openpgp-keypair                     This will generate a fresh, new OpenPGP
                                            compliant private/public key pair. The public
                                            key will be written to stdout and the private
                                            key will be written to the specified file.

  Options:
    --config CONFIG-FILE                    Json configuration file to use. See
                                            configuration section below to see what this
                                            file should contain. When calling the install
                                            target, this is the config file that the
                                            installation should use, rather than the
                                            config to use during install.
                                            [default: generic-worker.config]

                                            installation by querying the AWS environment
                                            and setting appropriate values.
    --nssm NSSM-EXE                         The full path to nssm.exe to use for
                                            installing the service.

    --username USERNAME                     The Windows user to run the generic worker
                                            Windows service as. If the user does not
                                            already exist on the system, it will be
                                            created. [default: GenericWorker]
    --password PASSWORD                     The password for the username specified
                                            with -u|--username option. If not specified
                                            a random password will be generated.
    --file PRIVATE-KEY-FILE                 The path to the file to write the private key
                                            to. The parent directory must already exist.
                                            If the file exists it will be overwritten,
                                            otherwise it will be created.
    --help                                  Display this help text.
    --version                               The release version of the generic-worker.

          signingKeyLocation                The PGP signing key for signing artifacts with.
          workerGroup                       Typically this would be an aws region - an
                                            identifier to uniquely identify which pool of
                                            workers this worker logically belongs to.
          workerId                          A name to uniquely identify your worker.
          workerType                        This should match a worker_type managed by the
                                            provisioner you have specified.

        ** OPTIONAL ** properties
        =========================

          cachesDir                         The location where task caches should be stored on
                                            the worker. [default: C:\generic-worker\caches]
          certificate                       Taskcluster certificate, when using temporary
                                            credentials only.
          checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs    The number of seconds between consecutive calls
                                            to the provisioner, to check if there has been a
                                            new deployment of the current worker type. If a
                                            new deployment is discovered, worker will shut
                                            down. See deploymentId property. [default: 1800]
          cleanUpTaskDirs                   Whether to delete the home directories of the task
                                            users after the task completes. Normally you would
                                            want to do this to avoid filling up disk space,
                                            but for one-off troubleshooting, it can be useful
                                            to (temporarily) leave home directories in place.
                                            Accepted values: true or false. [default: true]

                                            tasks, at a chosen maximum frequency (see
                                            checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs property), the
                                            worker will query the provisioner to get the
                                            updated worker type definition. If the deploymentId
                                            in the config of the worker type definition is
                                            different to the worker's current deploymentId, the
                                            worker will shut itself down. See
                                            https://bugzil.la/1298010

                                            An integer, >= 0. A value of 0 means "do not shut
                                            the computer down" - i.e. continue running
                                            indefinitely. [default: 0]

                                            number of megabytes of disk space are available
                                            when each task starts. If it cannot free enough
                                            disk space, the worker will shut itself down.

                                            required file) it will shutdown the host
                                            computer. Note this is generally only desired
                                            for machines running in production, such as on AWS
                                            EC2 spot instances. Use with caution!

                                            will have more information about how it was set up
                                            (for example what has been installed on the
                                            machine).

    Here is an syntactically valid example configuration file:

            {
              "accessToken":                "123bn234bjhgdsjhg234",
              "clientId":                   "hskdjhfasjhdkhdbfoisjd",
              "workerGroup":                "dev-test",
              "workerId":                   "IP_10-134-54-89",
              "workerType":                 "win2008-worker",
              "provisionerId":              "my-provisioner",
              "livelogSecret":              "baNaNa-SouP4tEa",
              "publicIP":                   "12.24.35.46",
              "signingKeyLocation":         "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-gpg-signing-key.key"
            }


    If an optional config setting is not provided in the json configuration file, the
    default will be taken (defaults documented above).

    If no value can be determined for a required config setting, the generic-worker will
    exit with a failure message.

```

# Start the generic worker

Simply run:

```
generic-worker --config CONFIG-FILE
```

# Create a test job

Go to https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-creator/ and create a task to run on your generic worker.

Use [this example](worker_types/win2012r2/task-definition.json) as a template, but make sure to edit `provisionerId` and `workerType` values so that they match what you set in your config file.

Please note you should *NOT* use the default value of `aws-provisioner` for the `provisionerId` since then the production aws provisioner may start spawning ec2 instances, and the docker-worker may try to run the job. By specifying something unique for your local environment, the aws provisioner and docker workers will leave this task alone, and only your machine will claim the task.

Don't forget to submit the task by clicking the *Create Task* icon.

If all is well, your local generic worker should pick up the job you submit, run it, and report back status.

# Run the generic worker test suite

For this you need to have the source files (you cannot run the tests from the binary package).

Then cd into the source directory, and run:

```
go test -v ./...
```

# Making a new generic worker release

Run the `release.sh` script like so:

```
$ ./release.sh 8.1.1
```

This will perform some checks, tag the repo, push the tag to github, which will then trigger travis-ci to run tests, and publish the new release.
